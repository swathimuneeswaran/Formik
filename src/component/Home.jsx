          Reading develops language skills and vocabulary.<br></br> Reading books is also
          a way to relax and reduce stress.<br></br> It is important to read a good book
          at least for <br></br>a few minutes each day to stretch the brain muscles<br></br> for
          healthy functioning.Books really are your<br></br> best friends as you can rely on them when you are bored,<br></br> upset, depressed, lonely or annoyed.
